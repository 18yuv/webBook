The project is ongoing, I am working on the front-end and back-end connection,
the aim of this project is to create a production ready web app with the full authentication system
like google sign in, verifying email, setting passwords if sined in through google, reset password,
resend verification email and all this is being done with production stnadards no shortcuts like firebase auth or next js auth, the old school passport js woth oAuth2 of google and nodemailer to send verification emails, all this is being done with all the privacy and secuirty standards, the backend is all complete just some final redirection tweaks, currently finishing the frontend.
