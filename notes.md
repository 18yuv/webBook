read me and gif and deployment and final tweaks and posts

clean redirects from axios and include if needed in backend or frotend, better return objects and check existing ones like the ones returning true when logged in, show dashboard after getting true from backend etc and protected routes throughout the backend and frotend, also auth limiter to limit the login attempts.
